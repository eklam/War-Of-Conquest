# War Of Conquest

> *Lords of Westeros,*
>  
> *As you may already know, the Targaryen family has refused to join the hold of the Free Cities.
> I refused for I have bigger aspirations; Westeros will bend the knee and pledge loyalty to the blessed Valiryan Dynasty.*
> 
> *The choice is your my lords, servitude, or Fire and Blood.*
> 
> *Aegon Targaryen, future King of Westeros*   

## Introduction

This variant aims to provide the scenario of the War Of Conquest, when Aegon Targaryen became the only King of the Westeros.
With Martells being the only exception, all the others Westerosi Kings were conquered and became mere Wardens of the land.
Will you let the history repeat itself? Try this variant and defend you country, or be the conqueror and wipe the land
with Fire and Blood.

## Main changes

- **Players** have 3 distinct roles (see below), at the beginning of the game Targaryen is the *Conqueror*, and all the other players are *Kings*
If any a *King* loses control of his home area to the *Conqueror* or *Lords*, he become a *Lord* himself, and is placed at the bottom of the Iron Throne track
    - If a player loses control to any other *King* he remains as *King*
    - Once a player become a *Lord* he cannot reclaim the status of *King*
- **Units: ** The max number of ships per player is 3 instead of the standard 6
  - *Why: The War Of Conquest was mainly battle on land, to emulate this the number of ships is reduced* 
- **Dragon Order: ** The Targaryen player has one new type of order, the *Dragon Order*.
This order can be resolved as a Raid Order, Support Order or as a March Order. When used as a Raid/March the order is discarded as usual.
  - *Why: To simulate the raw power of Targaryen dragons*
- **Tracks** with the exception below, the tracks works as usual 
  - Wildling Track becomes: 0, 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16 
  - **[KC] King's Court:** The number of special orders per player in the Crow track is:
    - Number of Special Orders: 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
